<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Wendy Masset, and I'm a 27-year-old girl who loves video games. I grew up with a passion for all things digital, and I'm thrilled to be able to turn that passion into a career.

  <p>Before pursuing my passion for coding, I worked as a data analyst for several years. While I enjoyed my job, I knew that I wanted to explore my interest in front-end development. I'm currently learning all I can about this exciting field, and I'm thrilled to be able to apply my knowledge to real-world projects.
  In addition to my work in front-end development, I'm also studying for my Bachelor of Systems and Business Administration. This degree will provide me with a well-rounded education that will enable me to pursue a variety of career paths in the tech industry.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not studying or working, you'll find me immersed in rpg videogames like pokemon, Dragon Age or World of Warcraft. I've always loved exploring new worlds in videogames, and I'm constantly seeking out new games to play. In fact, I'm always happy to chat about the latest releases or share tips and tricks with fellow gamers.
  
I'm excited to see where my passion for coding takes me in the future, and I can't wait to see what the tech industry has in store for me. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!</p>
